## 🎯 Objective

To evaluate the comfort levels and satisfaction of students engaged in virtual learning, particularly during the shift post-COVID, and analyze factors influencing their experience.

---

## 📊 Methodology

- **Approach**: Quantitative survey research
- **Participants**: 14 MSIT students (random sample from 140)
- **Survey Tool**: Google Forms
- **Analysis**: Descriptive statistics using Excel  
- **Framework Used**: Behavior Intention (BI) Model  
- **Survey Scale**: 5-point Likert scale

---

## 📈 Results

- **71%** of students scored above the mean value in their responses, indicating they feel comfortable using virtual platforms.
- **29%** were below the mean, suggesting discomfort with online learning environments.
- Factors for satisfaction included ease of access, flexibility, resilience, and reduced stress due to COVID-19 circumstances.
- Discomfort was tied to lack of in-person interaction, limited live support, and traditional learning preferences.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Virtual platforms are largely seen as effective and convenient.
- However, a minority of students feel disconnected due to reduced human interaction.
- Online learning tools must continue to evolve to support hybrid experiences.

---

## 📌 Limitations

- Small sample size (14 participants).
- Results may vary with different demographics or institutions.
- Possible neutrality in opinions not captured by Likert extremes.

---

## ✅ Validity & Reliability

- **Internal Validity**: BI model derived from academic frameworks and adapted appropriately.
- **External Validity**: May not generalize globally due to sample limitations.
- **Reliability**: Standard tools and well-tested survey methods used.
